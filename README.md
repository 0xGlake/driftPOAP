# driftPOAP
A couple POAP's for Drifts summer camp
(A POAP is a proof of attendance through NFTs)

ToDo List (if time persists)
- ~~Add toast notifications for errors and success~~
- ~~More mobile friendly UI~~
- Stop using duplicate code and use environmental variables instead (only thing that is different between the sites are the candymachine address and image)
